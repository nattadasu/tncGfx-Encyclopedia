### Aspect Ratio
The aspect ratio of an image is the ratio of its width to its height. It is commonly expressed as two numbers separated by a colon (`:`), as in 16:9. For an x:y aspect ratio, the image is x units wide and y units high. Widely used aspect ratios include 1.85:1 and 2.39:1 in film photography, 4:3 and 16:9 in television, and 3:2 in still camera photography.

### Dots per Inch (DPI)
DPI, or dots per inch, is a measure of the resolution of a printed document or digital scan. The higher the dot density, the higher the resolution of the print or scan. Typically, DPI is the measure of the number of dots that can be placed in a line across one inch, or 2.54 centimeters.

The higher the DPI, the sharper the image. A higher resolution image provides the printer and printing device more information. You can get more detail and greater resolution from an image with higher DPI.

A lower DPI will produce an image with fewer dots in printing. No matter how powerful your printer is, a low-resolution image doesnâ€™t provide enough raw data to produce high-quality images. The ink will spread on the page, making the edges look fuzzy.

Similarly, a monitor will measure the [pixels](#pixel) per inch, or PPI, of a video display. Typically, a printer must offer a higher DPI to match the color quality and resolution of a video display PPI. This is due to the limited range of colors in a print job.

### Pixel
A pixel is the smallest unit of a digital image or graphic that can be displayed and represented on a digital display device. Pixels are combined to form a complete image, video, text, or any visible thing on a computer display. A pixel is also known as a picture element (pix = picture, el = element).
