# Renaming File Automatically

> [!WARNING]
> This method may seem complicated to some, but ~~it is worth it~~ if you had categorized the cards when exporting data variables (and converted to .png) per design previously, this section may be easier to do.

> [!ATTENTION]
> Do this method one-by-one design.

1. Open Advanced Renamer and Excel file from exported Access data.

2. Drag-and-drop all the `.png` files of first design to the renaming app.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure it was alphabetically sorted as A-Z

3. On the renaming method list, add List from the add method button.

4. Once a list box appears:

   * If using Excel: restore the Excel window, sort Username alphabetically (A-Z) and sort it again on 1.

   * If using other: open CSV of the current design, make sure if the order is sorted alphabetically ascending (A-Z)

5. Copy usernames to the list box on the Advanced Renamer app.

6. Then add another method as "add."

7. On add box:

   1. Insert " - `n`" (include a space before dash, where's `n` is current design number).

   2. Check the "Backward" box.

   3. Set position to `0`.

8. Tap the "Start batch" button, a prompt will appear. Tap "start" to begin initializing.

9. Check the cards! If you have another card design, repeat step from the 2nd.
