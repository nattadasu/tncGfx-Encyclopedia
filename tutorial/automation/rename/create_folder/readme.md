## Comparison scripting languages by supported operating system

Some operating systems only support one type of the command scripting language, or it can be
supported by installing separately from first party or third.

This comparison cheatsheet is intended to make thing clear as we have tested in several operating
systems.

tl;dr, its Windows, but open source. It should be work fine.

<h5 id="bat-macOS">macOS</h5>

Status: **üë• Need to be installed manually (a client) first from a 3rd party**\
Source: Virtual machine

Description:\
Use any virtual machines app (or WINE for MacOS, Parallel Desktop, or Codeweavers CrossOver) to run
Windows Command Prompt.

<h5 id="bat-Linux">Linux</h5>

Status: **üë• Need to be installed manually (a client) first from a 3rd party**\

<h5 id="bat-Haiku">BeOS/Haiku</h5>

Status: **üë• Need to be installed manually (a client) first from a 3rd party**\
Source: Virtual machine

Description:\
Haiku OS (port of BeOS) known in the beta stage (I think). iirc, there‚Äôs no app for users to have
virtual machines. But, because I see Haiku is able to run Bash Shell script, maybe there‚Äôs an app
that requires to build from source code), CMIIW. ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

> [!NOTE]
> After further investigation on October 21, 2020, it seems `qemu` (an open source emulator) app was
> ported to Haiku OS (but not BeOS since it was discontinued). So installing Windows OS via `qemu`
> and using command prompt is possible.

#### PowerShell `.ps1` file

<h5 id="ps1-Windows">Windows</h5>

Status: **‚úî Supported**\
Source: Native

Description:\
Started from Windows Vista, PowerShell terminal was installed by default.

<h5 id="ps1-React">ReactOS</h5>

Status: **ü§î Unknown**\
Possible status: **üì•Need to be installed manually first from the 1st party.** /
**üë• Need to be installed manually (a client) first from a 3rd party**\
Source: Install 1st party app, Virtual machine

Description:\
Because ReactOS is backward-compatible with Windows apps, installing PowerShell onto ReactOS should
be able to run properly. This hypothesis has not been tested yet. Maybe you need to try to install
the PowerShell Windows version on React?

<h5 id="ps1-DOS">DOS</h5>

Status: **ü§î Unknown**\
Possible status: **‚ùå Not supported**

Description:\
Well, because DOS is actually **very old** and I bet no one uses DOS (except if you‚Äôre a masochist
tech geek, so you‚Äôre using DOS? :P), this method has not been tested yet. As far as I know, there‚Äôs
no port of PS to install/embed it into the system.

**üë• Need to be installed manually (a client) first from a 3rd party**\
Source: [PowerShell/PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)

Description:\
Download the official source code [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell). However,
Microsoft/PowerShell team does not provide an official guide on how to build PowerShell for BSD,
UNIX, nor UNIX-like OS. The best way is to use any VM or WINE on your machine.

Edit: but why do you want to make yourself get trouble if you do have a
[Bash supported terminal](#sh-BSD) on your system LOL?

<h5 id="ps1-Haiku">BeOS/Haiku</h5>

**üë• Need to be installed manually (a client) first from a 3rd party**\
Source: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), Git Bash, Cygwin, Virtual Machine

Description:\
To install Bash Shell compatibility to Windows OS, you need to install Git for Windows (complete),
any Linux distro on Microsoft Store with WSL 2 turned on (only for Windows 10 version 2004,
build 19041.450), or Cygwin. I recommend installing Git for Windows (for anyone), or WSL if
you understand the Windows-Linux ecosystem.

## Using BAT/CMD file format

1. Create a new bat (`.bat`) file with `notepad` by copying those line of codes.
   [](tutorial/automation/rename/create_folder/create_folder.bat ':include :type=code batch')
   Save those lines of code as `.bat` file to working directory. If applicable, use UTF-8 encoding
   with CRLF line ending for the script itself.

2. On `pushd "E:\5"`, change to the working directory.

3. On `FOR &&G IN (*.png) DO (` code line, change `.png` to current file format. Otherwise, you may
   continue.

4. Run the script.

## Using PS1 file format

1. Create a new PowerShell file (.ps1) file with `notepad`, `gedit`, or any text editor (preferably
   code editor), and copy-paste this script:
   [](tutorial/automation/rename/create_folder/create_folder.ps1 ':include :type=code ps1')
   Save those lines of code as a `.ps1` file to the working directory. If applicable, use UTF-8
   encoding with LF line ending for the script itself.

2. On `$dir = "E:\5"`, change `E:\5` to a working directory. Save the file after modifying the
   directory path.

3. Run the script.

## Using SH file format

1. Create a new shell (.sh) file with `notepad`, `gedit`, or any text editor (preferably code
   editor), and copy-paste this script:
   [](tutorial/automation/rename/create_folder/create_folder.sh ':include :type=code sh')
   Save those lines of code as `.sh` file to the working directory. If applicable, use UTF-8
   encoding with LF line ending for the script itself.

2. On `for f in *.png;`, change current file format (on PNG). Otherwise, you may continue.
3. Open `terminal`.
4. Specify working directory with `cd`.
5. Follow these steps:
    * If your `.sh` file is inside of your working directory, type `./<NAME OF YOUR SCRIPT FILE>.sh`
      with `<NAME OF YOUR SCRIPT FILE>` is your script file, ofc. Then press enter to proceed.
    * But, if your script is outside of the working directory, change `./` to ../, a.k.a add one
      more dot.

Notice that your file name format is following this:
`<Username> - <CardId> [Specification].<FileFormat>`
Dash between username and other text is required. Otherwise, you‚Äôll get bonked by system.
