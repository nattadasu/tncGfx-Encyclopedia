# Prerequisites

## Getting Started

Before we proceed with our first step, we need to prepare some important applications to be installed (available on your machine). Here is a list of software:

* [Windows Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089), [Microsoft PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell), or [Shell Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) supported bash terminal.
* [Microsoft Office Access](https://www.office.com/) (or any program that has backward compatibility with Access database file, like [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) Base)
* [Microsoft Office Excel](https://www.office.com/) **OR** [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets)
* [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) (any version that supports data variables feature)
* [Advanced File Renamer](https://www.advancedrenamer.com/)
* [XnView XnConvert](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/)

## Disclaimer

In this guide, I (Natsu) will using:

* Office 365 enabled subscription, thus some features may slightly place in different places on the "basic" version of Office (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019).
* Adobe Photoshop CC 2020 Portable.
* Windows 10 Home Edition (2004).

Keep in mind that some features that are included in the version I am using may not be included in your installed version. If so, you may search online for a guide on how to do so in your installed version.

Also, some words (or even lines) will be using mono serif font like in the previous section, to show technical "language."

## FAQ

### Why using Microsoft Office Access? Isn't Excel or Sheets enough?

Look, I know Microsoft Excel has a great job at handling data. But we are facing a collection of strings... which Excel is not very capable of handling such things. Excel is proposed as more statistical in terms of data but dynamic, so it can show some graphics like charts. Plus, Excel is known for the lack of features that general consumers need (and their rival, Google Spreadsheet has those), checkbox and line break for example. Access, on the other hand, does have several features that Excel does not have too as I mentioned earlier. So, managing data as server-grade management is easier to do rather than Excel.

I forgot to mention that adding or deleting a collection of data on Access Table will show a confirmation dialogue box, which means that the unfortunate data loss would be very less.

But Access is also hard to use for daily basis customers. So, in this guidelines/documentation, we will use both, so anyone can understand how to manage data.
